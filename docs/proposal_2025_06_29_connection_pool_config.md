# Proposal: Add Connection Pool Configuration

**Date:** 2025-06-29  
**Status:** Proposed  
**Type:** Enhancement  
**Priority:** High

## Description
Currently, the database module doesn't expose connection pool configuration options, which are crucial for production applications to handle concurrent connections efficiently.

## Current Limitations
- No control over connection pool size
- Potential resource exhaustion under high load
- Inefficient connection management
- Limited ability to tune for specific workloads

## Proposed Changes
1. Add configuration options to `Open` and `OpenWithConfig` functions:
   ```go
   type PoolConfig struct {
       MaxOpenConns    int           // Maximum number of open connections
       MaxIdleConns    int           // Maximum number of idle connections
       ConnMaxLifetime time.Duration // Maximum amount of time a connection may be reused
       ConnMaxIdleTime time.Duration // Maximum amount of time a connection may be idle before being closed
   }
   ```

2. Update database initialization to apply these settings
3. Add validation for pool configuration values
4. Document recommended settings for common scenarios

## Expected Benefits
- Better resource utilization
- Improved performance under load
- More predictable database behavior
- Prevention of connection leaks
- Better scalability for high-traffic applications

## Potential Drawbacks
- Additional configuration complexity
- Need for documentation on optimal settings
- Potential for misconfiguration
- Slight overhead from additional configuration processing

## Alternatives Considered
1. **Global Defaults**: Using environment variables for pool settings
   - Pros: Simpler configuration
   - Cons: Less flexibility, harder to manage in microservices

2. **Automatic Tuning**: Automatically determine pool sizes
   - Pros: Less configuration needed
   - Cons: May not be optimal for all workloads

## Implementation Notes
- Backward compatibility must be maintained
- Default values should be sensible for most applications
- Documentation should include performance tuning guidelines
- Consider adding metrics for pool usage monitoring

## Next Steps
1. Gather feedback on the proposed configuration options
2. Finalize the configuration structure
3. Implement the changes
4. Add tests for the new functionality
5. Update documentation with examples and best practices
